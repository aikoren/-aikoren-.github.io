          <p class="banner-text">I have always been a creative person, most of my hobbies are based on creating and
            design. I studied marketing and graphic design some years ago, and I get well with english because most of
            my hobbies like videogames requires some english level. <br> </p>
          <p class="banner-text">I loved cartoons since I was a kid, and I love them even today. Now I'm a toy
            collectionist and a big geek/Japan culture fan.

            <h2>Cat Lover</h2>
            <p>I love all cats üíó. They are fluffly, warm and playfull. I had always have cats as pets. Now I have one
              single son called Sif. </p>

            <h2>I Love Japan</h2>
            <p>The Japan culture is the origin of almost all my hobbies. When I was a kid I enjoyed to watch japanese
              cartoons a lot, then I started to draw them, paint them, craft things that appeared on the series and even
              make my own cosplay costumes. </p>
            <p> Japan food is also a big inspiration for me, I love to cook japanese recipes üç£. </p>

          <div class="col-md-12 hobbie third-hobbie">
            <h2>Foodie</h2>
            <p>As I said earlier, food makes me <strong>really</strong> happy üçî. I don't just enjoy eating, like the
              urban dictionary says about a "foody" but I love to cook and learn about it too.</p>

          <div class="col-md-12 hobbie fourth-hobbie">
            <h2>Web Developer</h2>
            <p>I started web development as a hobbie too. Now I can say I do something I love for a job.</p>
            <p>I started styding and practicing web development some day in 2017, and started to share the activity with
              other people around 2019. Getting to know new people and share our knowledge is what made me feel really
              comfortable with coding and kept all my attention on it since I started.</p>
