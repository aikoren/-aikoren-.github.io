        <h2>Cat Lover</h2>
        <p>I love all cats üíó. They are fluffly, warm and playfull. I had always have cats as pets. Now I have one single son called Sif. </p>

        <h2>I Love Japan</h2>
        <p>The Japan culture is the origin of almost all my hobbies. When I was a kid I enjoyed to watch japanese cartoons a lot, then I started to draw them, paint them, craft things that appeared on the series and even make my own cosplay costumes. </p>
        <p> Japan food is also a big inspiration for me, I love to cook japanese recipes üç£. </p>

        <h2>Foodie</h2>
        <p>As I said earlier, food makes me <strong>really</strong> happy üçî. I don't just enjoy eating, like the urban dictionary says about a "foody" but I love to cook and learn about it too.</p>

        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        <p>I wanted to put the web development here as a hobbie because it's a new and really big thing for me and it comes out that I enjoy it a <strong>lot</strong>.</p>
        <p>On december last year I started to study web development online and alone in Udemy, but this year I started to share this activity with others. I met a lot of people: new developers like me and people of the community in my city. I enjoy this a lot and I want to grow my career around this beautiful experience. </p>
